        <h1>A Comprehensive Approach to Preventing Naval
Accidents through Modern Signalling and Tracking</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Abstract:</h2>
            <p>Maritime safety remains a critical concern in the
prevention of boat and naval accidents. This paper outlines a
comprehensive strategy to improve marine safety by integrating
contemporary tracking and signaling technology. By utilizing
cutting-edge technologies, the suggested approach improves situ-
ational awareness for both boats and naval vessels by supplying
real-time information. Our method builds a strong system that
can recognize and reduce any threats by combining state-of-the-
art tracking technology with cutting-edge signaling strategies.
The system utilizes navigation patterns, vessel locations, and
environmental information to prevent accidents before they
happen. IoT technology is used to monitor the real-time data
anywhere in the naval path and all the sensor parameters can
be visualized in the web interface. Presenting a comprehensive
approach that incorporates contemporary signaling and tracking
technology, this study adds to the continuing conversation on
maritime safety by providing a viable means of reducing the
dangers connected with boat and naval mishaps in the ever-
changing marine environments of today.
